# **Overview**
An implementation of a FIFO matching engine in C++ 14. This projects serves as the learning
platform for my C++ knowledge. This implements two execution strategies GTC and FOK (Fill or Kill). Along with two order types market and limit order. If you're looking to see more order types and/or execution strategies let me know by raising an issue.

# **Requirements**
A chosen compiler e.g. g++.

git clone https://github.com/JadoreThompson/cpp-order-matcher.git

cd cpp-order-matcher

# Compiler - if you're using g++

# Run
